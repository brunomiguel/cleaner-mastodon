# Cleaner Mastodon userstyle
### Userstyle to provide Mastodon with a cleaner look.

If you find Mastodon's advanced interface cluttered and overwhelming, this userstyle is for you. Before using it, keep the following in mind:
- It's only tested with Mastodon's advanced interface (the columns layout);
- Explicitly made for Mastodon's default dark theme;
- Custom Mastodon themes may break with this userstyle;
- Only compatible with the Stylus extension. Similar extensions may or may not work.

Don't forget to change the instance domain after installing it.
